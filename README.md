# terrapin-heat-transfer-modeling
Senior research project - *Mathematical Modeling of Road to Plastron Heat Transfer and its Effect on Internal Temperatures of Malaclemys terrapin terrapin*

Submitted to Jersey Shore Science Fair (JSSF) at Stockton University

conductiontestswitherror.ipynb - Stats and visualization for the conduction trials

errorbargraph.ipynb - The error bar graph from the conduction trials

radiation_testing.ipynb - Same as the conduction trial file, but using the radiation data instead

finalmodel.ipynb - The final model + code used to generate the last few graphs

Thank you for checking out the GitHub for this project. Have a great day!

# Update 1/2021: This repository was initially made for a science fair submission last year. I'm going to be working on this project again sometime soon, adding cooler math stuff and potentially moving it to Julia!
